# YouTube Comment Toxicity Analyzer

The goal is to fetch comments from YouTube videos and then analyze whether they are toxic, hateful, spammy, or neutral using Natural Language Processing (NLP) + Machine Learning.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Fetch Comments â€“ Use YouTube Data API to extract comments from a video.

Preprocessing â€“ Clean text (remove emojis, links, stopwords).

Toxicity Detection â€“ Use:

Pre-trained models (e.g., Googleâ€™s Perspective API, Hugging Face models).

Or train your own ML model with datasets like Jigsaw Toxic Comment Dataset.

Classification Categories:

Toxic

Severe Toxic

Obscene

Threat

Insult

Identity Hate

Neutral

Visualization â€“ Show percentage of toxic vs. non-toxic comments.

Streamlit App (Optional) â€“ Build an interactive web app for demo.
